The Airline Management System (AMS) project is designed to streamline and automate various aspects of airline operations to enhance efficiency, customer satisfaction, and data management. By integrating functionalities such as flight scheduling, booking, check-in, and reporting into a single platform, the AMS aims to reduce manual errors, provide a seamless user experience, and support scalability for growing demands. Key features include role-based access control, real-time flight updates, online booking and check-in, customer relationship management, crew scheduling, and comprehensive reporting. Utilizing technologies like Java/Spring Boot for backend development, MySQL for database management, and AWS for cloud services, the system ensures robust performance and security. Ultimately, the AMS seeks to revolutionize airline operations, making them more efficient and customer-centric.
